    <p>Gnarly tree roots are a great subject matter for sketching; they are organic, and imprecise which leaves plenty of room for ‘mistakes’.</p>
    <p>I took this idea from FZD school (blog <a href="https://fzdschool.com/blog_posts/sketching-101">post</a>). This kind of sketch can be done in layers, corresponding to stages of detail:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>rough sketch</li>
        <li>detailed sketch</li>
        <li>line weight</li>
        <li>shading wash</li>
    </ol>
